EasyLog
=======

console.log made easy with simplicity.

Just copy paste the code below at the top of your code to start it
=====
(function(){Object.defineProperty(window,"log",{set:function(a){console.log(a)}})})();

then
====
just write:...

log='hello world';

instead of writing console.log('hello world'); 
which is a combination of lots of awkward keystrokes that need to be pressed.
